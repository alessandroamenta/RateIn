# LinkedIn Profile Analyzer üöÄüíº

Welcome to the LinkedIn Profile Analyzer! This tool not only reads your profile but also visually analyzes your profile picture to provide detailed feedback and actionable suggestions for elevating a LinkedIn profile.

## How It Works

Our app leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-4 Vision models through the Assistants API, integrating both text and visual analysis capabilities. Here's a quick overview:

- `app.py`: The frontend of the application, built with Streamlit. It manages the user interface, facilitating easy interaction and displaying insights directly to you.
- `main.py`: Initializes the OpenAI Assistant specifically designed for LinkedIn profile optimization, incorporating retrieval from documents and custom function calling.
- `linkedin_scraper.py`: Gathers data from your LinkedIn profile URL, preparing it for comprehensive analysis by the Assistant.

### Simple Steps for Users:
1. Input your LinkedIn profile URL.
2. The app scrapes your profile data, readying it for in-depth analysis.
3. Our custom AI Assistant, enhanced with vision capabilities, examines both the content and the profile picture, ensuring a holistic profile evaluation.
